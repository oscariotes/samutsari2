It’s been a while since I first promised my son that I will take him to the zoo… You can just imagine how long ago that was considering that my son is now 6 years old… I guess we were really caught up with work that we didn’t find the right time to go (talking about being defensive, ha-ha!).

Finally, a good opportunity came to me one morning while I was browsing the web. I was reading some blogs and I stumbled upon one that talks about their trip to Avilon Zoo… I then checked Avilon’s website and found out about their special offer. So, I immediately registered on their site and availed of their 50% discount, regular price is P700/head and I got mine at P350/head… Hooray!!!

The smile on my son’s face was heavenly when I finally announced that we are going to the zoo… Oooh, the hugs and kisses; the jumping and shouting (literally screaming) around the house… He was just unstoppable… He was very, very excited and he just can’t stop babbling about what he’d do when we get there… I have to brace myself for the worst as there will be a lot of chasing to happen…

So, time to head off to Avilon Zoo… It was a Sunday and we left our house at 5:30AM as we wanted to avoid the summer heat… I thought that it would be a quick trip as we were coming from Antipolo but it still took us less than 2 hours to get there… Good thing it was Sunday and it’s still early for traffic to build up…

We reached Avilon Zoo at around 8:30AM. We headed straight to the entrance and presented our voucher ticket. We then left our lunch bag at the package counter and off we went to see the animals (we’re not excited, are we?)…. After our first stride, we decided to grab our lunch… There was a restaurant inside the zoo but since we have packed our lunch, we just occupied their tables and ate (we actually occupied 2 tables… Ha-ha)…

Here are some of the photos we’ve managed to capture…
