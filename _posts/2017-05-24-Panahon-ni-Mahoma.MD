We Filipinos have an expression when we see something old or outdated we say “panahon pa ni Mahoma yan”. But who is Mahoma anyway? Well there’s a lot of explanation floating around the internet about who he really is? Some say he was a Japanese Imperial Army general  assigned here in the country during WW2. 

One thing is for sure that expression was way much older than you expect. The name Mahoma  is mistranslated Spanish word of the name Muhammad.  Our grade school teachers taught us that before the Europeans arrive in our shore, the Philippine islands were populated by natives of Islamic faith.

Islam predates Christianity in this country. As a matter of fact some practices of Islam so deeply ingrained in our culture that we have all the boys circumcised even before reaching puberty.

So when you hear that expression” Huy! Panahon pa ni Mahoma yan”, expect that it’s really old and predates Magellan.
