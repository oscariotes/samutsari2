Rainy season is coming or should I say it’s already here. This season comes with lot's of happy childhood memories. It would be more memorable if you would prepare adobong kangkong with inihaw na hito for lunch.
 
Well this happened when I was a kid. My older sister with her family left for a quick vacation and I was left to look over her home and pets while they were away. They have a neighbor named kuya Jasmine whom they asked to look over me while they were gone, Yes, I know kind of nonsense (they could asked the neighbor to look after the house and pets).
 
During that time Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City is not what it looks like today. Back then the place were mostly rice paddies or swamps filled with hito (catfish), tilapia, talangka (freshwater crabs) and kangkong (water cabbage or spinach).
 
Kuya Jasmine for several days has been watching a pair of giant catfish ( half the size of adult man )with their babies lots of them the (size of wriggler) swimming around the backyard before noon. He hatched a plan to catch them using electricity plugged directly to the outlet when they pass through. He made some safety measure by using only the live wire leaving the ground wire cut or disconnected. Still dangerous though.
 
The plan was he will standby near where he can grab the fish as soon as I unplug the wire from outlet. The time comes and the fish swam near the spot where he can grab it. He made a hand gesture for me to plug it in which I did immediately. I saw the fish being electrically shocked and they struggled until they stopped and turned belly up. With his go signal I unplugged the wire. He grabbed one and he struggled to get hold of it since it fights to escape. Then I panicked. A foolish child as I was, I plugged the wire with my kuya still waist deep in the water. The electricity stunned him, knocking him down as well. The fish escaped while he was dazed and confused. There goes our lunch.
 
He understood that I panicked and said that the method was dangerous. What we did was settled for kangkong laying around to be made adobo. Just in case you will ask for a recipe, here it is.
 
**Adobong Kangkong**
 
* 1 bunch kangkong
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 3 to 5 cloves garlic, minced
* ¼ pound pork (optional)
* Tokwa, 3 pcs. (optional)
* ½ cup vinegar
* ¼ cup soy sauce
* ½ cup water
* pepper to taste

**INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Trim the kangkong stalks and discard. Cut kangkong into pieces lengths, separating the sturdier stalks from the leaves. Wash thoroughly.
2. In a cooking pan, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until limp. Add pork and cook, stirring regularly, until lightly browned.
3. Add vinegar and bring to a boil. Continue to cook, without stirring, for about 3 minutes. Add soy sauce and water. Bring to a boil for about 1 to 2 minutes. 4. Lower heat, cover and cook for about 8 to 10 minutes or until pork is tender and sauce is reduced. Season with pepper to taste.
5. Add kangkong stalks and cook for about 2 minutes. Add kangkong leaves and cook, for a minute. Then serve.
 
That’s about it. Inihaw na hito might be a fine addition for our lunch. But that’s life.
