Basically a VPN creates a secure connection between your computer or phone and server operated  by the VPN service. Instead of your computer directly connected to network the VPN tunnels the connection to the server and the server will do the rest downloading and uploading the data from the network. 
 
A common scenario will be like this, VPN will allow access to employees working outside the company network to login to their local intranet service. It will also allow employees restricted to their intranet to access the internet using VPN service outside the company’s network.

**Why you should use VPN?**

Basically, VPN only does one thing: route internet traffic. 
 
As mentioned , you can create a private session between you and your work network or you can even have a VPN that directs traffic to a different server depending on your location: There are paid service as well a s free ones available. Google search will help.
 
**Access to blocked content.** There are  lots of services like media streaming that can't or won't let you use them if you're not located in that particular country. We see this a lot like Netflix, news or sports channel blocking your access because of your area or country.
 
**Security** Although  VPN is not an all in one solution, but using one with encrypted connections from a reputable company creates what's called a tunnel that acts as a one-layer connection between you and your online activities. This makes tracking difficult to  anyone or any service except the VPN server provider itself. This can be prevented if you will create the server itself. People like journalists or activist can see or say things in private. And so can everyone else. Privacy is not limited for the select few.this can be exploited by people with bad intentions, they can use a VPN to have the same privacy and security. 
 
**Issues using VPN**

There are downsides to using a VPN. The biggest will be technical issues. Operating a VPN requires a deep understanding of network security issues and a way to make sure to prevent any security flaws. That's enough reason why you have to know you are using a service you trust. The provider must be honest and open with their policies in relation to privacy.  They should be fully competent enough since computer networking is constantly evolving. Don't try just sign up for a VPN service  and run your own VPN if you don't do enough research on networking security. 
 
**Additional Issues:**
 
Slow and grinding connection. You might have excellent internet service and all the things you like are fast, but when you start a VPN in the middle you probably will see things get slower. Sometimes, too slow that it will ruin your experience.
 
**Conclusion:**
 
Well VPN is not for everyone. If you find no reason to hide your online activities then no need for you to add additional burden to your bandwidth. Primarily if your main concern is accessing it for work or security then you should choose one provider that will suit your needs. I have bee using a VPN software called [Sofether](https://www.softether.org/) to access my work computer whenever I am. It’s an open source and free for everyone to use. It has a feature to access your work or home computer network even without configuring your own router. Perhaps I can further discuss in detail how this software works in the future.
