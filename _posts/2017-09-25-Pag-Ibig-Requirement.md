**Pag-IBIG Loan Eligibility**
The first thing that you really need to have accomplished is to have made 24 months’ worth of contributions to Pag-IBIG in order to qualify, as the minimum amount you can borrow is calculated dependent on the number of contributions a member has made. Given that you haven't paid for it, Pag-IBIG accepts retroactive payment to fill the 24 month requirement.

Calculations for it are made according to the number of months (24) multiplied by the member/employer contribution and then the loan factor of 60% is applied. Pag-IBIG also accepts voluntary contribution for individuals like self emplyoed one.

The amount you can take out on loan rises as your monthly contributions increase, and so does the loan factor. An member who has made contributions for 120 months or more can take out a loan at an 80% factor.
