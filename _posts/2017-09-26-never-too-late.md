The biggest problem that people with lower incomes is investing? The old saying that the rich will get richer is true, and for those living like minimum wage earner, there isn't enough money left to put towards investing. 
The fact remains that if you don't save money for later years, you will face a gloomy situation. Comes a time, when you won't be able to work and social security pension won't be enough for to live a decent living.
 
First, we have to look at this problem of limited funds and the advice isn't really new. Something in your life has to go, but it doesn't have to be a big life change. How often do you go to fast foods for your morning coffee? How often do you go to the nearest malls and restaurant for lunch, and how many times have you hit the bar to unwind a little after a hard day at work?

What if you cut out even half of those expenses each month, netting you an extra 500 pesos per month? At the end of a year, you would have around 6,000 thousand pesos to invest. Over 10 years that 6,000 could become more than 60,000, if you saved that same 500 each year. 6,000 may not seem like much to get started, but anything is better than nothing, and there are places to put that 6,000 to that will make a big difference.

**Savings account and time deposits**

Investing in a savings account and time deposit is basically one of the good investment we can start right. It is good to put your money in the bank than keeping it in your wallet. The interest or return could be low, it is much better than having nothing to turn to during rainy days.


**Mutual funds**

Another good investment is mutual funds. The idea is you’ll have to pool your money together with other investors and the fund manager will take care of the investments. There are different types of mutual funds you can choose to depend on your goals. Mutual funds have its own risk but in the long run the return will be better compared to time deposits.


**Real Estate**

If you want passive income, and you have an adequate capital to work with, real estate might be for you. Many people invest their money by acquiring condominium units and renting them out. By getting attractive properties in good locations, you can get a regular monthly income given that you have regular tenants. You can also try AirBnb and have your place rented for couple of days or weeks. 

**Conclusion**

Most people, if they're willing to give up a few small luxuries, can find small amounts of money to invest into their retirement. It’s never too late to invest and remember it’s not about how much you earn, it’s how much you keep.
